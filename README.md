# IlluminaHumanMethylationEPIC2
Annotation package for Illumina EPIC v2 Human DNA methylation arrays, based on IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19
This is not ready for use yet, it is being built using the scripts shipped with IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19. 
These require some changes and of course testing due to changes in Illumina's manifest column names.  
The manifest file also appears to have some duplicate probe names.
